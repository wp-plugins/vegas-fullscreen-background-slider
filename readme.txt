A fullscreen background slideshow plugin

== Description ==

A fullscreen background slideshow plugin based on Jay Salvat's <a href="http://vegas.jaysalvat.com/">Vegas Background jQuery Plugin</a>

You can see a working demo at <a href="http://demo.jamesdbruner.com/">http://demo.jamesdbruner.com/</a>

== Installation ==

1. Upload `vegas-slider.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode [vegasslider id="This id is generated when you create a new slide" fade="however much you want in miliseconds" overlay="url of a pattern"]
e.g. [vegasslider id="565" fade="1000" overlay="http://mydomain.com/urloftheimage/"]

4. There is also a title parameter similar to id, fade and overlay though it's not for everyone so the default is off.  

It adds the title and content from slider you made and adds them to the page on the bottom right. Similar to <a href="http://vegas.jaysalvat.com/">this</a>

e.g. [vegasslider id="565" fade="1000" overlay="http://mydomain.com/urloftheimage/" title="yes"]
Anything other than "yes" for the title and it wont work.
